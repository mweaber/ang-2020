<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
<!-- ngModel needed [()] as shown above. Using the ="name" code we can change the below <p> tag to whatever is typed into the input. ngModel is not added on creation of the project and must be added into the 
  app.module.ts file in the imports at the top and inside the imports inside the ngModule. Angular has several useful ng components we can use but they need to be imported. -->
<p>{{name}}</p>
